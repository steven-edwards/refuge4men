### **We will provide a 24 hour a day, 365 days a year dedicated helpline for men suffering domestic abuse and in crisis.We shall collaborate with businesses, organisations and individuals to educate, inform and raise awareness on this subject.**

**We offer the very best services in our field. We never settle for second best and always have your satisfaction as our top priority. Itâ€™s who we are and we are proud of it.**

#### Who We Are

We realised through extensive market research with businesses and individuals in the community, that there is an overwhelming need for the creation of awareness and signposting on the subject matter of male domestic abuse in the UK.

It is often seen as a 'taboo' subject, particularly for men who are just as much in need of support as others. Having a wealth of experience in the charity and voluntary sector, we decided to form a not for profit organisation Community Interest Company (C.I.C) in order to address this issue.

#### Strategies & Plans

* We are launching a 24 hour a day, 365 days a year dedicated helpline for men suffering domestic abuse to enable them to access help, support & signposting services, when they need it most via our network of invaluable 'Friends' who individually all have their specialist knowledge on a vast array of subjects pertaining to domestic abuse.
* Through our workshops and seminars with businesses and organisations, we will educate their staff on the services available and raising awareness within the workplace on the subject of male domestic abuse.
* Within the business community we shall be highlighting the effects domestic abuse has within the workplace, including absenteeism, lost revenue and the effect on general work performance by staff being affected by illness, distraction or fatigue caused by this often perceived' taboo' subject. The obvious knock on effects to the economy is that without this awareness, businesses that may be thriving can then struggle due to diminished productivity and therefore loss of income, leading to business failings.
